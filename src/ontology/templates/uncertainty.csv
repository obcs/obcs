OBCS:0000357,moral uncertainty,道德不确定性,,uncertainty,"Moral uncertainty stems from the underlying moral issues related to action and inaction in any given case. De Marchi notes that, though similar to legal responsibility, moral guilt may occur absent legal responsibility when negative consequences might have been limited by the dissemination of prior information or more effective management for example. ""Moral uncertainty is linked to the ethical tradition of a given country be it or not enacted in legislation (juridical and societal norms, shared moral values, mores), as well as the psychological characteristics of persons in charge, their social status and professional roles"" (De Marchi, 1994). Moral uncertainty would typically be high when moral and ethical dimensions of an issue are central and participants have a range of understandings of the moral imperatives at stake.",http://www.nusap.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-Glossary&file=index,Jinjing Guo|Oliver He|Jie Zheng,classification to be confirmed

Some salient characteristics of these differences will be different views about the role of consensus versus conflict, on locating responsibility between individuals and larger groups, on views about the legitimacy and role of social and private institutions, and on attitudes to authority and expertise. From De Marchi (1994).

OBCS:0000360,proprietary uncertainty,所有权不确定性,,uncertainty,"Proprietary uncertainty occurs due to the fact that information and knowledge about an issue are not uniformly shared among all those who could potentially use it. That is, some people or groups have information that others don't and may assert ownership or control over it. ""Proprietary uncertainty becomes most salient when it is necessary to reconcile the general needs for safety, health, and environment protection with more sectorial needs pertaining, for instance, to industrial production and process, or to licensing and control procedures"" (De Marchi, 1994). De Marchi notes that 'whistle blowing' is another source of proprietary uncertainty in that there is a need for protection of those who act in sharing information for the public good. Proprietary uncertainty would typically be high when knowledge plays a key role in assessment, but is not widely shared among participants. An example of such would be the case of external safety of military nuclear production facilities.",http://www.nusap.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-Glossary&file=index,Jinjing Guo|Oliver He|Jie Zheng,classification to be confirmed

It refers to individual behaviours or personal interventions in crisis situations"" (De Marchi, 1994) and as such represents a form of integration over the other six types of uncertainty. That is, it tends to combine the uncertainties one has to face in a given situation or on a particular issue. High situational uncertainty would be characterized by situations where individual decisions play a substantial role and there is uncertainty about the nature of those decisions.",http://www.nusap.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-Glossary&file=index,Jinjing Guo|Oliver He|Jie Zheng,classification to be confirmed
OBCS:0000362,psychological uncertainty,心理不确定性,,subjective uncertainty,"A belief is psychologically certain when the subject who has it is supremely convinced of its truth. Certainty in this sense is similar to incorrigibility, which is the property a belief has of being such that the subject is incapable of giving it up. But psychological certainty is not the same thing as incorrigibility. A belief can be certain in this sense without being incorrigible; this may happen, for example, when the subject receives a very compelling bit of counterevidence to the (previously) certain belief and gives it up for that reason. Moreover, a belief can be incorrigible without being psychologically certain. For example, a mother may be incapable of giving up the belief that her son did not commit a gruesome murder, and yet, compatible with that inextinguishable belief, she may be tortured by doubt.
