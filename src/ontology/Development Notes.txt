2/7/2014:

(1) Assert term "statistical hypothesis test objective" To under OBCS term "inferential statistical data analysis objective".
Note: did not change the process.


3/24/2014:
(1) Change OBI: descriptive statistical calculation data transformation
	(has_specified_output some 'data set of features')
 	or (achieves_planned_objective some 'descriptive statistical calculation objective')
 	->
	achieves_planned_objective some 'descriptive statistical calculation objective' 
	
Because with OBI original definition, median, mode, etc. will be inferred as 'data set of features' which is not correct.
(2) Remove imported 'data set of features', have some issues with the term, will submit issue to OBI tracker for discussion
