The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.  @en"

INFO	lowercase_definition	STATO:0000112	IAO:0000115	"a Funnel plot is a scatter plot of treatment effect versus a measure of study size and aims to provide a visual aid to detecting bias or systematic heterogeneity. A symmetric inverted funnel shape arises from a ‘well-behaved’ data set, in which publication bias is unlikely. An asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect and study size. 
Known caveats: If high precision studies really are different from low precision studies with respect to effect size (e.g., due to different populations examined) a funnel plot may give a wrong impression of publication bias. The appearance of the funnel plot can change quite dramatically depending on the scale on the y-axis — whether it is the inverse square error or the trial size.
Funnel plot was introduced by Light and Palmer in 1984.@en"

It is useful for modeling the runs of consecutive successes (or failures) in repeated independent trials of a system.

The geometric distribution models the number of successes before one failure in an independent succession of tests where each test results in success or failure.


The geometric distribution with prob = p has density

p(x) = p (1-p)^x

for x = 0, 1, 2, …, 0 < p ≤ 1.

If an element of x is not integer, the result of dgeom is zero, with a warning.

The quantile is defined as the smallest value x such that F(x) ≥ p, where F is the distribution function.@en"
