OBCS example

= Introduction =

We generated an OWL file contained expression of 3 different genes (TNFRST17, MAPK1, CNOT2) on the response to TIV vaccination of 3 persons at day 0, 3, and 7 based on the semantic representation shown in Figure 3. It shows how data item grouped as a data set and data set grouped as a data set of set. The planned processes shown in Figure3 linked the data which collected from experiment to conclusion generated from analysis.

The OWL file shows how microarray data and data workflow can be represented in a well-structured manner. It enables possibility to build data analysis pipeline and automate this process using software.
