= Introduction =

For users to explore and understand better about how OBCS can help biomedical data annotation and analysis, we generated an example data set using a use case of gene expression data post vaccination for seasonal influenza in humans [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21743478 Ref 1]. 

This example shows how OBCS can be used to represent full data analysis process from data collection to drawing a conclusion based on data.

= Ontological representation =

The ontological representation of the influenza microarray study shown as below.

The example web page includes a small OBCS subset that contains all the terms, relations, and axioms introduced in Figure 3 use case. This OBCS subset was generated using the tool Ontodog (http://ontodog.hegroup.org/) (10). Instantiating the classes in the OBCS subset, we generated an extended OWL file that contains the information of instance level transcriptional expressions of 3 genes (TNFRST17, MAPK1, and CNOT2) in the PMBCs collected from three persons at day 0, 3, and 7 after an administration of TIV. This example shows how data items can be grouped as a data set, and data sets grouped as a data set of set. As shown in Figure 3, the planned processes link the data sets collected from experiments to the conclusion based on data drawn from statistical data analysis. 	



We generated an OWL file contained expression of 3 different genes (TNFRST17, MAPK1, CNOT2) on the response to TIV vaccination of 3 persons at day 0, 3, and 7 based on the semantic representation shown in Figure 3. It shows how data item grouped as a data set and data set grouped as a data set of set. The planned processes shown in Figure3 linked the data which collected from experiment to conclusion generated from analysis.

The OWL file shows how microarray data and data workflow can be represented in a well-structured manner. It enables possibility to build data analysis pipeline and automate this process using software.
