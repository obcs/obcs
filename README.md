# Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS)

The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is a biomedical ontology in the domain of biological and clinical statistics. OBCS is primarily targeted for statistical term representation in the fields in biological, biomedical, and clinical domains.

OBCS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as the upper level ontology. OBCS imports all biostatistics related terms in the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) including all logical axioms. 138 new statistics terms have been generated with the "OBCS_" prefix.

OBCS was initiated with an ANOVA meta-analysis of vaccine protection assay, which was presented in the Bio-Ontologies 2010 conference (2). Many statistics-related terms (e.g., ANOVA, survival rate analysis) were added into OBI at that time. Many more statistics terms have been added into OBCS with original name of "OBIstat" and discussed in the OBI face-to-face workshop in Ann Arbor in May 2012 (3).   

The OBCS development is driven by many applications including vaccine research statistics study, and nursing clinical statistical data collection and analysis.  

The latest release version of OBCS is available on:
* Ontobee website: http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=OBCS
* Bioportal website: http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/OBCS
